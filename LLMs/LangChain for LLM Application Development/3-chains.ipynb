In other words, it is a number that when raised to any power and multiplied by itself, results in the same value as the power itself plus one. This property is expressed mathematically as:\\n\\ne^x = x! for all non-negative integers x\\n\\nThis means that e is the limit of (1 + 1/x)^x as x approaches infinity.
